Stunted is a
[not-framework](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=8826)
to make it both possible and more pleasing to program in a
somewhat functional style in Ruby. It also contains examples
of functional style.

In the future, it will build on top of, or bring together, gems
written by other people.

Documentation is in the [wiki](https://github.com/marick/stunted/wiki).
There is a mailing list for [functional programming in Ruby](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyfoopers).
